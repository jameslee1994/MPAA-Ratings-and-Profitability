Dataset Ideas for Final Project

1. EV Registrations by State
I drive a Rivian R1S, and I can’t leave my house without seeing several. I am curious whether Utah has an outsized number of them. So I was hoping to find some data to show me which states have the most Rivians per capita. Also it seems lots of Utahns drive electric cars but Utah has very few Level 3 (fast) chargers, to the point I wonder where Utah ranks in ratio of L3 chargers to EVs. These two data sets show where EVs are registered, and counts of L3 chargers by state.

2. Movie Revenue vs Ratings
I have noticed over the years how animated movies tend to make a ton of money at the box office and have family friendly ratings. Yet most of the movies released these days seem to have family un-friendly ratings that make less money at the box office. This makes me wonder if there is any actual correlation between ratings or genre and box office success. Do family movies earn more than R-rated ones? Do big budgets always win? This data might help me see which ratings and genres do the best.

3. Border Crossings (U.S.–Mexico)
I found this great government data source with data about border crossings over time. This data shows cars, trucks, buses, and people. I would be curious to dive into this data and see what trends the data show vs what I see in the news.

4. Global Energy Use and Production
I have solar panels on my house, and I don’t understand all the hate against solar, yet our national grid is undersized?  Meanwhile, I have read that China has made huge investments in solar. I found a great time-series source of global data on this and am curious to see how energy demand and production differs between countries. I’m most curious about the U.S. and China.
